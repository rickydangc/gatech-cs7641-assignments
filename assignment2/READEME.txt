# CS 7641 Assignment 2: Randomized Optimization

In this repository, we performed four different random optimization algorithms (Randomized Hill Climbing, Simulated Annealing, Genetic Algorithm and MIMIC) in two parts. 

> Part I: Three optimization algorithms have been applied on three different discrete optimization problems (Eight-Queen Problem, Max-K Color Problem and Travelling Salesperson Problem).
> Part II: Applied three algorithms (Randomized Hill Climbing, Simulated Annealing and Genetic Algorithm) on Neural Networks to optimize weights of the NN.


- All these algorithms are implementation with mlrose library in Python3.
- Dataset: Heart Disease Dataset - available at /data folder.


## Get Started

- Python 3.6
- Pip install requirements.txt
- Open Anacona Jupyter Notebook


## Running the Jupyter Notebook

There are five Jupyter Notebooks:
- Eight Queen Problem
- Max-K Color Problem
- Travelling Saleperson Problem
- Neural Networks Experiments
- Neural Networks Final

1. First Option: Click 'Run All', it will run all codes in the notebook.
2. Second Option: Run the code step by step, the notebook will print the output every step.
