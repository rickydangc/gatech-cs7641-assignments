# CS 7641 Assignment 3: Unsupervised Learning

In this repository, we performed two most common clustering algorithms K-Means and Expectation Maximization; four different dimensionality reduction algorithms including Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Independent Component Analysis (ICA), Random Projection (RP) and Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA). 

- All of these algorithms are implemented with scikit-learn and scipy library in Python3.
- Dataset: Heart Disease Dataset - available at /data folder.

## Get Started

- Python 3.6
- Pip install requirements.txt
- Python run_experiments.py

## Running the Jupyter Notebook

- heart
- cancer

1. First Option: Click 'Run All', it will run all codes in the notebook.
2. Second Option: Run the code step by step, the notebook will print the output every step.
