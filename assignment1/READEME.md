# CS 7641 Assignment 1: Supervised Learning

In this repository, we performed five classification algorithms (Decision Trees, 3-Layer NN, Gradient-Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT), Support Vector Machines and k-Nearest Neighbors) on two different binary classification datasets(balanced and imbalanced).

Dataset 1: Heart Disease Dataset - available at /data folder
Dataset 2: SynPUF Dataset  - available at /data folder

## Get Started

- Python 3.6
- Pip install requirements.txt
- Open Anacona Jupyter Notebook


## Running the Jupyter Notebook

There are two Jupyter Notebooks:
- Heart Disease Predication
- SynPUF Diabetes Predication

First Option: Click 'Run All', it will run all codes in the notebook.
Second Option: Run the code step by step, the notebook will print the output every step.

Each Jupyter Notebook has been divided into following blocks:

- Best model performance with 5-fold CV
- Learning/Scalability Curves for 5 ML methods
- Hyperparameter Tunning for 5 ML methods
